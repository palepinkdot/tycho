## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a minor vulnerability in Ferdi, please create a new issue on GitHub. Minor vulnerabilities are those, that do not leave the user at immediate danger, i.e. though remote code execution.

If you discover a major vulnerability in Ferdi, please report it to us via E-Mail to `hello@getferdi.com`, prefixing your E-Mail subject with "[Security]". We will then come in contact with you as quickly as possible.

Please keep in mind that some vulnerabilities you find may not be due to Ferdi but instead due to ElectronJS or Chromium. In that case, please contact the owners of those projects instead.
